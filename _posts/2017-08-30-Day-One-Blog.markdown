Welcome to the MicroMatt blog, the blog and project portfolio for micromatt.tech and MicroMatt on YouTube. I plan to update this blog once every week or so with what is going on with certain projects and with the website itself.

As you may have noticed this site is, so far, a one page wonder. There are links that don’t go anywhere, empty spaces, etc, etc. Over the next few months I plan to populate these pages and get a fully working website before the new year, I am also taking steps to make a mobile version of the website. Furthermore, I do plan on adding Jekyll to this site, which will allow me to better serve blot like posts and keep the site up to date - I’ll let you know how it goes.

As for content on this web-based portfolio, expect to see tech content, varying from tech reviews to in depth tech related projects - such as computer/server builds and electronic design.

I don’t plan to start the majority of my larger projects I have planned until the new year and 2018, but I will update this site over the next coming months, some projects that I definitely want to start include a DIY keyboard, a MicroChip PIC18 development board and various home servers.

Now a bit about me - I am a 20 year old tech enthusiast currently studying The Bachelor of Engineering (Computer and Network Science). I have a strong love for all sorts of tech including PC components, programming and electronic design.

If you want to keep up to date with MicroMatt, I have a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/chuffs97 "My Twitter") and a [YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsjYwlaeT48XV7kxRLkE6bw "My YouTube Channel") - I do plan to add some form of newsletter at a later stage too.

Thank you for reading the first entry of the blog, I hope to post more and be as active as I can be. Peace for now,

Matt
