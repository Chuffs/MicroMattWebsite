A small update on the website side of things - We are now using cookies to hide or display the "beta overlay" popup that appears in the bottom right side of the homepage, so that returning visitors don't continue to see it after they have hit the little 'x'. You can still see the To-Do list by visiting: [micromatt.tech/beta/](/beta/).

Over the next few days I'll be updating the Privacy Policy to reflect this change as well as adding an easy access link to the Policy Page, which can currently be found by visiting [here](/privacypolicy.htm).

In other news, I should be starting work on the introduction/channel trailer video for the channel shortly - which will then allow me to complete the about page and get that ticked off the list. I want to ideally start releasing videos in the new year, but I think that might have to be delayed somewhat due to the delay in getting the channel trailer finished and a personal holiday coming up. Hopefully the release of the new channel won't be delayed past the end of Jan 2019, maybe even start in Feb 2019...

I think that is all I have to fill in, peace for now,

Matt
