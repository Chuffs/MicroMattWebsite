You can still see the To-Do list by visiting: &lt;a href=&quot;/beta/&quot;&gt;micromatt.tech/beta/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days I’ll be updating the Privacy Policy to reflect this change as well as adding an easy access link to the Policy Page, which can currently be found by visiting &lt;a href=&quot;/privacypolicy.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I should be starting work on the introduction/channel trailer video for the channel shortly - which will then allow me to complete the about page and get that ticked off the list. I want to ideally start releasing videos in the new year, but I think that might have to be delayed somewhat due to the delay in getting the channel trailer finished and a personal holiday coming up. Hopefully the release of the new channel won’t be delayed past the end of Jan 2019, maybe even start in Feb 2019…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that is all I have to fill in, peace for now,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working 30+ hours a week, all whilst studying a full time load and thus have had no time to work on the site. We are in the midst of exam period for uni, with my last exam being next week. Once that it over and done with, I can refocus my attention to getting the site finished and cleaned up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am planning on adding the pages that the navbar link to first, followed by improving the layout of the blog post page.. I will then work on making the site more user friendly and working on the mobile side of things - If you are reading this on mobile: I am sorry, I am so so sorry…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, back to study I go - peace for now,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit it took a &lt;strong&gt;VERY&lt;/strong&gt; long time to convert it to the more fluid and dynamic ways of Jekyll. As you can see the homepage is a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; different to what it was in “version one”. I have added a  few more parts to the page, such as sections for an about the site (about me page will be coming later, along with a contact form) as well as a truncated snapshot of the most recent blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really do like how Jekyll operates and compiles the site, it gives you the option to have a much more versatile and modular webpage design - I just wish the documentation included more. It remind me very much of PHP in the way that you can have several different files combined into one page, for example - our homepage: this page consists of 6 files, but Jekyll compiles it all into one when it ships the site. You use includes to add multiple html files into the one that you see on the site. These includes then allow me to use other sections of the this home page in other pages without having to rewrite all the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the homepage is now done, I might add a little more later - touch up on the styling or add a few more sections. To do next is other pages, such as the blog archive, portfolio archive and each post page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll update the blog once that is done, Peace for now,&lt;/p&gt;

I plan to update this blog once every week or so with what is going on with certain projects and with the website itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed this site is, so far, a one page wonder. There are links that don’t go anywhere, empty spaces, etc, etc. Over the next few months I plan to populate these pages and get a fully working website before the new year, I am also taking steps to make a mobile version of the website. Furthermore, I do plan on adding Jekyll to this site, which will allow me to better serve blot like posts and keep the site up to date - I’ll let you know how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for content on this web-based portfolio, expect to see tech content, varying from tech reviews to in depth tech related projects - such as computer/server builds and electronic design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t plan to start the majority of my larger projects I have planned until the new year and 2018, but I will update this site over the next coming months, some projects that I definitely want to start include a DIY keyboard, a MicroChip PIC18 development board and various home servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a bit about me - I am a 20 year old tech enthusiast currently studying The Bachelor of Engineering (Computer and Network Science). I have a strong love for all sorts of tech including PC components, programming and electronic design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep up to date with MicroMatt, I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chuffs97&quot; title=&quot;My Twitter&quot;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsjYwlaeT48XV7kxRLkE6bw&quot; title=&quot;My YouTube Channel&quot;&gt;YouTube account&lt;/a&gt; - I do plan to add some form of newsletter at a later stage too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading the first entry of the blog, I hope to post more and be as active as I can be. Peace for now,&lt;/p&gt;
