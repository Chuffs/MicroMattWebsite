When I first made this website I created every single page individually and painstakingly tested each and every link and each and every margin/padding and design of the page. I started thinking to myself "This is going to become extremely hard once I add more than 10 blog entries to the site... There must be another way..." That's when I discovered [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank" class="blog-links"}.

Jekyll is a ruby gem program available on many linux distributions that allows you to make a dynamic website into static pages to be hosted on a simple webhoster such as Github Pages. Using this tool, you can create a website that has thousands of blog posts and not have to worry about writing each page separately.

Installing Jekyll on a linux distribution is fairly straight forward, just make sure you have rubygems installed and up to date and follow the instructions found on the ([Jekyll Homepage](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank" class="blog-links"}).

On windows you have two options. Ruby can be used on windows via [Ruby Installer for Windows](https://rubyinstaller.org/){:target="_blank" class="blog-links"} and then used via PowerShell or CMD. Another way to run Jekyll on Windows is to use the Linux Subsystem for Windows - which if you have need for any other linux based tools, is a very useful addition to Windows 10. This is the method that I use regularly as my main driver is a Custom Built Desktop running Windows 10.
