The site is now using Jekyll!

I have to admit it took a **VERY** long time to convert it to the more fluid and dynamic ways of Jekyll. As you can see the homepage is a *little* different to what it was in “version one”. I have added a  few more parts to the page, such as sections for an about the site (about me page will be coming later, along with a contact form) as well as a truncated snapshot of the most recent blog post.

I really do like how Jekyll operates and compiles the site, it gives you the option to have a much more versatile and modular webpage design - I just wish the documentation included more. It remind me very much of PHP in the way that you can have several different files combined into one page, for example - our homepage: this page consists of 6 files, but Jekyll compiles it all into one when it ships the site. You use includes to add multiple html files into the one that you see on the site. These includes then allow me to use other sections of the this home page in other pages without having to rewrite all the code.

I think that the homepage is now done, I might add a little more later - touch up on the styling or add a few more sections. To do next is other pages, such as the blog archive, portfolio archive and each post page.

I’ll update the blog once that is done, Peace for now,

Matt
