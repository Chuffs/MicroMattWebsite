The past few weeks have been absolutely hectic.

I’ve been working 30+ hours a week, all whilst studying a full time load and thus have had no time to work on the site. We are in the midst of exam period for uni, with my last exam being next week. Once that it over and done with, I can refocus my attention to getting the site finished and cleaned up.

I am planning on adding the pages that the navbar link to first, followed by improving the layout of the blog post page.. I will then work on making the site more user friendly and working on the mobile side of things - If you are reading this on mobile: I am sorry, I am so so sorry…

Anyways, back to study I go - peace for now,

Matt
